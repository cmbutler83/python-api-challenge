# python-api-challenge

This was a challenging assignment where we had to use a lot of what we have learned. It really helped me grasp Matplotlib and the use of scatter plots and linear regression.

Weatherpy was a good project that helped us discover how different aspects about a city's weather and how far that city is from the equator can have a negative or positive correlation.  

Some of these results were shocking, and I learned a lot. I added my observations to the bottom of my Weatherpy code

Vacationpy was also interesting where I got to utilize our newly learned skills in geocoding.  

It's awesome to be able to pull very specific things like hotels from a city area while filtering out diffrent aspects of that data.

I hope the hvplot.pandas will work soon because I am very excited to plot cities on a map as well!

Overall, this assignment was extremely difficult, but the feeling of success when I finally got it to work was so satisfying!
